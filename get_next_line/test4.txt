Read from stdin => read from fd 0: Whenever we write any character from the keyboard,
it reads from stdin through fd 0 and saves to a file named /dev/tty.
Write to stdout => write to fd 1: Whenever we see any output to the video screen,
itâ€™s from the file named /dev/tty and written to stdout in screen through fd 1.
Write to stderr => write to fd 2: We see any error to the video screen, it is also
from that file write to stderr in screen through fd 2.
